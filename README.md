# Tax-calculator
It is a tax bracket calculator
On the left handside of the GUI is a the entry bar for user to enter their income and get back the tax that they needed to pay.
According to the spreadsheet on the right which is a file called the "tax_table" 

Extra note:
The spreadsheet in GUI is really ghetto style which meant it can work up to maybe 10 brackets at most before the GUI cannot handle the extra text of the spreadsheet
